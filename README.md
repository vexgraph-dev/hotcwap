# hotcwap. hot-c-wap. R0 Kernel Host — thin nano-VM.

Zero-downtime dynamic module hot-reloading, persistent OS windowing, and process supervision.

A play on the term **hot swap** — `hotcwap` is an infrastructure runtime designed to reload compiled C23 dynamic libraries in real-time without restarting the process, losing application state, or destroying the native operating system window.

In conventional game architectures, window management and simulation loops are tightly tangled. If a module crashes, reloads, or reconfigures, the window flickers, the graphics device is destroyed, and the event pump restarts. 

`hotcwap` enforces a strict architectural division: **a window belongs to the operating system and Thread 0, while simulation and graphics logic belong to reloadable modules.** By holding the window handle stable in `hotcwap`, modules and shaders can be swapped seamlessly on the fly.

## Key Architecture & Strengths

* **OS Window Decoupling**: Thread 0 hosts the native platform window (`AppKit` / Cocoa on macOS; X11/Wayland on Linux). The display link, event pump, and surface layer persist indefinitely across module reloads.
* **Vulkan CAMetalLayer Bridge**: Directly connects native Cocoa windows to MoltenVK / Vulkan swapchains via hardware-accelerated `CAMetalLayer` surfaces (`objc/window_cocoa.m`).
* **Microsecond Dynamic Reloader**: Monitors file manifests and filesystem timestamps (`hot/manifest.c`, `hot/hot.c`) to detect newly built dynamic libraries (`.dylib`), swap function pointer dispatch tables, and rebind entry points with zero frame interruption.
* **Vulkan GPA Loader**: Integrated `vkGetInstanceProcAddr` dynamic loader (`hot/vk_loader.c`) that extracts Vulkan symbols dynamically without requiring hard linkage to external loader stubs.
* **Ultra-Low Latency Event Pump**: Decoupled polling for keyboard, mouse, and touch events at 1000Hz resolution.

## Workspace Integration & How to Use It

`hotcwap` sits at R0 in the `vexgraph` supervisor order (Rule 17: `R0 hotcwap > R1 vexspoke > R1.5 graphvex > R2 features > R3 engines`). It boots first as Kernel Host, owns the master + transient arenas and the Application registry, and tears down last — depending only on `vexspoke` shapes + `graphvex` GPU types, never on `darling`/`api-haven`/engines:

### Kernel lifecycle (the 7 steps — vk_test order)

```c
Kernel *k = Kernel();              // 1. kernel: master + transient arenas
Application *app = Application("vex vk probe"); // 2. application
Kernel_addApplication(k, app);     // 3. adding an application in the kernel
Window *w = Window();              // 4. window (OS-owned, never hot-updated)
Application_addWindow(app, w);     // 5. adding a window to the application
Application_run(app);              // 6. run the application (Phase 1: blocking, single-app)
Application_free(app);             // 7a. end the application (detach-only)
Kernel_destroy(k);                 // 7b. end the kernel (stops apps, arenas LAST)
```

### 1. In-Tree Integration (Subdirectory)
When integrated inside an umbrella workspace:

```cmake
# In your top-level CMakeLists.txt
add_subdirectory(projects/hotcwap)

add_executable(my_app main.c)
target_link_libraries(my_app PRIVATE hotcwap vexspoke)
```

### 2. Standalone Integration (FetchContent Seam)
When building standalone or in downstream projects:

```cmake
if(NOT TARGET hotcwap)
    include(FetchContent)
    FetchContent_Declare(
        hotcwap
        GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/vexgraph-dev/hotcwap.git
        GIT_TAG main
    )
    FetchContent_MakeAvailable(hotcwap)
endif()

target_link_libraries(my_app PRIVATE hotcwap)
```

## What's in this repo

* **`kernel/kernel.h/.c`** — R0 Host Supervisor (thin nano-VM): `Kernel {arena, transientArena, applications[KERNEL_MAX_APPS]}`. Boots first, tears down last. Holds opaque Application handles + callbacks, never engine headers.
* **`app/application.h/.c`** — Executable identity + window registry: `Application {CLI/TUI/GUI}` with `windows[APP_MAX_WINDOWS]`. Final infrastructure engines rely on, never reverse.
* **`window/window.h/.c`** — Platform-agnostic window abstraction: creation, sizing, fullscreen toggles, input event dispatch, and title management.
* **`window/window_linux.c`** — Linux X11/Wayland display backend.
* **`objc/window_cocoa.m`** — Native macOS AppKit implementation: `NSWindow`, `NSView`, and `CAMetalLayer` creation with Retina backing scale handling, subpixel event mapping, live-resize/zoom-to-fill orchestration, and native macOS desktop Spaces fullscreen lifecycle.
* **`hot/hot.h/.c`** — Dynamic module reloader: `dlopen`/`dlsym` lifecycle wrappers and runtime state preservation.
