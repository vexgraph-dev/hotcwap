# Contributions & Engineering Manifesto (hotcwap)

This project is a strictly solo development process conducted in tight pair-programming partnership with an AI coding assistant.

It serves as an architectural manifesto for **Level 4 Self-Management and OS Windowing**: hot-reloading dynamic modules, managing OS window lifecycles, and bridging AppKit and Metal with zero steady-state allocation.

## 1. The AI-First Architecture Manifesto & Boilerplate Defense

This codebase strictly enforces the verbose, explicit boilerplate required across the `vexgraph` ecosystem:
- Strict prohibition of arrow syntax (`p->field` is banned; only explicit `(*p).field` is permitted).
- Single Class Per File (the Java Law: one public `typedef struct` per `.h`/`.c` pair).
- Arity-overloaded explicit constructor dispatch macros (`Class_0()`, `Class_1()`).
- Complete, symmetric getters and setters for all struct fields.
- Strict dest-last parameter ordering `(a, b, dest)`.
- Two-layer member access cap (`(*layer1).layer2` maximum).
- Exhaustive `;;OVERVIEW` blueprints mirrored at the top of every implementation file.

### Why the Boilerplate Exists
This boilerplate is **not** an accident, nor is it a misunderstanding of idiomatic C. It is an intentional, machine-verifiable scaffold built specifically for **AI-Human Pair Systems Programming**:
1. **Machine Comprehension**: By eliminating `->` and restricting every file to a single class, an AI coding agent can hold the exact, un-aliased memory layout of any component in its context window without hallucinating field collisions.
2. **Explicit Indirection**: `(*ptr).field` makes every pointer dereference visible and accountable.
3. **AI-Maintained Rigor**: The AI agent authors, refactors, and validates the dense boilerplate, freeing human focus for high-level OS synchronization, dynamic module swapping, and memory safety.

## 2. Sanity Warning for External Contributors

> [!WARNING]
> **SANITY NOTICE FOR EXTERNAL CONTRIBUTORS**
> This repository is not designed for traditional C conveniences, casual hacking, or stylistic shortcuts. It is an unapologetic, machine-verifiable manifesto of AI-augmented systems architecture.
>
> **If you do not approve of this architecture or cannot find peace with this philosophy, consider leaving this repository for your own sanity.**
>
> We do not accept Pull Requests, issues, or unsolicited stylistic refactors attempting to re-introduce `->`, combine multiple classes into one file, or bypass explicit getters/setters. Upstream is maintained exclusively by the author and the AI agent.

## 3. Supreme Living Document: `preferences.md`

All architectural rules and style invariants are governed by the central constitution:

- **[preferences.md](https://github.com/vexgraph-dev/vexspoke/blob/main/preferences.md)** (tracked in `vexspoke`, accessible locally at `../../preferences.md`)

Whenever preferences or conventions evolve, `preferences.md` is updated and committed locally in the same cycle (Zero Drift Law).

## 4. `hotcwap` Architectural Invariants

| Invariant | Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| **L4 Self-Management** | Level 4 substrate: watches, verifies ABI, swaps, and retires dynamic libraries without restarting the process. |
| **Two-Layer Split Architecture** | Bottom layer is the Vulkan swapchain (or transparent NSVisualEffectView blur); top layer is composited `CALayer`s backed by `IOSurface`. |
| **Zero Steady-State Allocation** | No `malloc`/`calloc` in window event loops, live resize, or module reload paths. |
| **Teardown Order Top-Down** | Detach before free: `Window_destroy` -> `Darling_shutdownCompositor` -> `Vk_shutdown` -> `Memory_freeAll`. Freeing the arena before detaching OS views causes zombie windows and leaks. |
| **Bounded Waits on Joined Threads** | Fences and worker joins must take explicit timeouts (e.g. 100ms) with a drop-degrade path; infinite waits (`UINT64_MAX`) on joins freeze teardown. |
